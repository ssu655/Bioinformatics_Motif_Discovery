    "In genomes, there often exist short DNA words of length k (k-mers), that are unusually frequent in localized regions. For example, transcription binding sites, which are often clustered together near promoters. The following code demonstrates the search for repeated k-mers in a fixed-length window in a genome. The detailed algorithm is implemented in FindClumps method, and the E. coli genome is shown as an example. "
